    The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) EDGAR system is host to financial
    reports and other investor notices that public companies are required to file according to 
    United States federal law (Securities Act of 1933 & 1934).

    We source our data directly from the SEC at the end of each trading day. You can download and inspect the raw archives
    that we process our data from by visiting <a href="https://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/Feed">https://sec.gov/Archives/edgar/Feed</a>

    Currently, the supported form types we provide from the SEC are:

    <table class="table qc-table table-striped">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <td style="font-weight: bold">Form Type</td>

            </tr>
